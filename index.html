                    Hello, my name is Connor Stevenson. I am a senior at the University of Iowa studying Business
                    Analytics and Information Systems. I enjoy working with data and seeing how it can be presented in
                    various formats. I have experience using Python, SQL, and R to make group projects where we
                    presented data using different charts and graphs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Outside of school I enjoy a variety of different things. These include:
                <ul>
                    <li>Video games</li>
                    <li>Soccer</li>
                    <li>Basketball</li>
